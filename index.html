        <h1 style="color: darkviolet;">The Gospel</h1>
        <p style="color: gold;">The Gospel is very simple a man named Jesus Christ who is both fully man and fully God
            came down from heaven to be amongst humanity and in the end die for the world's sins. He who knew no sin(Jesus)
            became sin for us that we may be able to be in heaven with our heavenly father.
        </p>
        <p style="color: gold;">The death of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was God paying the wages of sin(which was death)
            and now if we believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and he died for all the sins
            of the world and he rose from the grave on the third day you will be saved.
